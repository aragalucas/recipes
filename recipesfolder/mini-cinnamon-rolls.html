     let your helpers choose from four filling options, and let it roll.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>4 cups bread flour or all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoons cinnamon</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Icing</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>    
        <li>Mix together milk and water in a glass measuring cup for the dough. Microwave mixture until it reaches 105 degrees F to 115 degrees F (40 degrees C to 46 degrees C), 30 to 60 seconds.</li>
        <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, melted butter, and milk mixture. Beat with an electric mixer at medium speed until a soft dough forms and begins to pull away from sides of bowl, 3 to 5 minutes. (Dough will be sticky.) Lightly grease a bowl. Transfer dough to the bowl and turn to coat. Chill, covered, until dough is easy to handle, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Grease two 9-inch round cake pans or two 8x8-inch baking pans.</li>
        <li>Stir together brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Punch down dough; divide in half. Roll out one portion of dough on a lightly floured surface into a 6x16-inch rectangle. (If dough springs back when rolling, let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.) Spread 2 tablespoons softened butter over the dough. Sprinkle half of the cinnamon-brown sugar mixture over butter; gently pat mixture so it adheres to the dough.</li>
        <li>Starting on a long side, roll up dough and pinch along seam to seal. Slice dough log into 16 (1-inch-thick) pieces. Put rolls, cut sides down, in one of the prepared pans. Repeat with the remaining dough, cinnamon-sugar, and softened butter. Let rise, covered, in a warm place until rolls nearly double in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake until rolls until golden brown, 17 to 22 minutes. Cool in pan on a wire rack 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile for the icing, beat cream cheese, softened butter, milk, and vanilla with an electric mixer at medium speed until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually beat in powdered sugar until smooth. Drizzle rolls with icing and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
